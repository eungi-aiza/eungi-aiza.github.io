# eungi-aiza.github.io

This repository is the source for a simple GitHub Pages blog with a
Notion‑style layout. A fixed left sidebar lists the available sections
and the main area shows content for the selected page.

## Structure

* `index.html` – home page with sidebar navigation
* `machine-learning.html` – placeholder for Machine Learning posts
* `moderation.html` – placeholder for Moderation posts
* `css/style.css` – shared styling for sidebar and layout

## About the template

The `about.html` page explains how this minimal GitHub Pages template works
and how to extend it. It lives alongside the other topic pages and is
linked from the sidebar.

Feel free to update that page with your own notes or remove it once you no
longer need the instructions.

Add additional pages by creating new `.html` files and linking them in the
sidebar list.

The site can be deployed directly via GitHub Pages (enable in repo
settings).  Feel free to convert to Jekyll or another generator later.
